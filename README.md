# Take Reading Easy iOS App

<h2> What? </h2>

Take it Easy takes a piece of text and prints it word by word. After printing each word, the program pauses to allow the reader to have read the word before printing the next word.

<h2> IOS APP: </h2>

The program pauses as long as the syllables in the word. 

I'm working on adding the speech recognition to the web interface. Stay Tuned!

<h2> Python Script: </h2>

The program listens to the speaker and proceeds after the reader has read the word. The program used Google Speech to Text library to check for read word, and uses fuzzywuzzy library to allow for an approximation of pronunciation - not needing 100% accuracy of speech.

<h2> HOW? </h2>

How I Made a Speech-Driven Slow Reading Program

<h2> WHY? </h2>

Ever since I was very young I have had a mild stutter. I have learnt overtime to control it but it can take effort. The most important thing for me to always remember is to speak slow.

However, since I started school, there has always been a pressure to do things fast!

Read Fast.

Do Math fast.

Write Fast

Answer Fast, and even Think fast! 

Because of this I often end up talking really fast. What helps is to be forced to read slow which I often take time to do with help of my family.

I tried to look for some tool or app to assist but what I found were apps to actually help you read faster and faster! 

So I made a tool - to help myself and others like me. Everyone who wants to take it a little slow.
